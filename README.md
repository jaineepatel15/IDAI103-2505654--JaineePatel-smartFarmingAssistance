The Smart Farming Assistant is an AI-powered app to support farmers in Brazil with data-based farming insights.

Smart Farming Assistant (Brazil)

Overview:
The Smart Farming Assistant is an AI-based application developed to support farmers in Brazil by helping them make better everyday farming decisions. The app combines artificial intelligence with local agricultural data to provide guidance related to crop care, weather conditions, soil health, and sustainable farming practices.
It is designed to be practical and easy to use, especially for farmers who may not have regular access to expert agricultural advice.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to make smart farming more accessible and reliable for farmers by using AI to support decision-making. The app aims to:
Improve crop productivity and reduce losses
Help farmers respond to changing weather conditions
Encourage efficient use of water, fertilizers, and other resources
Support sustainable and environmentally responsible farming practices

Target Audience:
The primary users of this app are:
Small and medium-scale farmers in Brazil
Farm owners and agricultural workers
Young farmers interested in adopting technology
Rural communities with limited access to professional agricultural support

User Persona (User Problems):
Name: João Silva
Age: 42
Location: Rural Brazil
Occupation- Small-scale farmer
João depends largely on experience and intuition to manage his farm. While this has worked in the past, changing climate conditions and rising costs have made farming more uncertain. He often struggles with:
Unexpected weather changes that affect crop growth
Identifying crop diseases at an early stage
Knowing when and how much to irrigate
Deciding the correct type and amount of fertilizer to use
The Smart Farming Assistant is designed to address these challenges by providing timely, data-based suggestions that are easy to understand and apply.

User Research Insights and Survey Summary:
To understand the needs of farmers, basic user research was conducted through online surveys, informal interviews, and secondary research focused on agriculture in Brazil.
Key findings from the research include:
Many farmers continue to rely mainly on traditional farming methods
Weather unpredictability is one of the most common causes of crop loss
Farmers expressed interest in simple, clear recommendations rather than complex technical data
There is a strong preference for tools that are accessible, practical, and relevant to local conditions
Overall, the research showed a clear need for a user-friendly AI tool that supports farmers in making better decisions without replacing their existing knowledge and experience.
